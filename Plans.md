9-4 is a holiday
next steps and what to do with this texture now that we have it
1 - make sure we flip and rotate the image correctly
    manipulating the for loop
    that would be more performant (but it's hard)

    after

2 - Getting the texture to actually act as an occlusion map.

will probably consist of using command buffers again on the main camera
and having the main camera taking it's texutre and using a custom material
that if the depth of the distance is so far or whatever the max depth or whatever,
then toss out that pixel.

and this depends on how we

if you create a game object, add a material to it that can do the depth sampling (don't really like that because
it requires object by object manipulation)


let's presume the depthimage texture consists of 3 values total.  0, .5, and 1.
if we have an object, the depth of it (its value) will be determined by it's 'distance' from the camera.
so if the object is being rendered at .25 distance, it will appear in front of all parts of the depth image with 
a value of .5 and 1.  if the object is at .75 distance, it will appear behind depth image values of .5 and in front of 
depth image values of 1.

the questions are
how do we extract/quantify depthimage texture values? 
how do we assign/quantify AR object depth values?
how do we get these two values to interact on a pixel by pixel basis?


Yes, that's a feasible approach for object occlusion in an Augmented Reality (AR) application. Essentially, you would be doing a form of per-pixel depth testing between the AR object and the real-world objects represented in your depth map. Here's a simplified outline of how this could work:

Steps
Capture Depth Image: Capture a depth image from the camera that shows the real world. Each pixel's depth is stored in the red channel, as you've been doing.

Generate AR Object Depth: For each pixel where the AR object is rendered, generate a depth value that represents the object's distance from the camera.

Depth Comparison: Compare the depth value of each AR object pixel with the corresponding depth value in the captured depth image. If the AR object is closer to the camera for a given pixel, it should occlude the real-world object at that pixel.

Render or Don't Render: Based on the depth comparison, decide whether to render each pixel of the AR object or to let the corresponding pixel of the real-world object show through.



// Obtain depth values from the real-world depth image
Color[] realWorldDepthPixels = depthTexture.GetPixels();

// Assuming ARObjectDepthPixels is an array that stores the depth values for the AR object
float[] ARObjectDepthPixels = ...;

// Loop through all pixels
for (int i = 0; i < realWorldDepthPixels.Length; i++)
{
    float realWorldDepth = realWorldDepthPixels[i].r;
    float arObjectDepth = ARObjectDepthPixels[i];
    
    // Depth comparison logic
    if (arObjectDepth < realWorldDepth)
    {
        // Render the AR object pixel
    }
    else
    {
        // Do not render the AR object pixel, let the real-world object show through
    }
}


Points to Consider:
Coordinate Matching: Make sure that the coordinates between the AR object and the depth image match. The depth image and the AR scene should be aligned so that you are comparing the correct pixels with each other.

Efficiency: This operation could be quite expensive if done on the CPU for every frame and every pixel, especially at higher resolutions. You might want to consider doing this on the GPU using shaders for better performance.

Depth Scale: Make sure the depth scale for the AR object and the real-world depth map are compatible or normalize them so they are.

Interpolation: Real-world and AR object depths might not align perfectly, so you might need to perform some form of interpolation to get better occlusion results.

By implementing this logic, you can achieve more believable interactions between AR objects and the real world.

Absolutely, let's organize the tasks into the three categories you mentioned: things to do programmatically, things to do in the Unity editor, and a step-by-step guide that ties everything together.

### Things to Do Programmatically

1. **Capture Depth Information**: Use your existing code or system to capture real-world depth information into a `Texture2D` (e.g., `depthTexture`).

    Where do we want to localize this functionality?  
    Case for Client-Side: keeps the client computationally lean, performing most complex calculations on most robust hardware.  gives access
    to unity interface which could extend the functionality of this implementation.
    Case for Server-Side:  The rendering and depiction of occlusion would happen on the device itself which would give a more accurate depiction of performance/behavior. 
    // If it is done client side, we wouldn't be able to see it on the phone. It is possible that we could render object occlusion using the depth texture on the server-side and see it represented client-side, depending on which camera we use. //
    Case for Both Sides:  just sum the above points.

    Ashe: Do it Client-Side because we know that the server-side has all the ingredients *TO* do it, and we're already sending all the ingredients to the Client.
  
2. **Generate Command Buffer**: Create a Command Buffer to capture the real-world depth texture.

    Probably put this bad Mamma-Jamma in CommandBufferActions in CustomNdiSender.cs (line 78, 51, 44)
    -or-
    Client Receiver, InitializeCommandBuffer line 124

    ```csharp
    CommandBuffer commandBuffer = new CommandBuffer();
    commandBuffer.name = "Capture Depth";
    // Add necessary commands to capture depth
    ```

3. **Attach Command Buffer to Camera**: Add the Command Buffer to the main camera at the appropriate event point.

    Could theoretically do this in ClientReceiver, InitializeCommandBuffer, line 131

    Would need to figure out how this works Server-Side
    ```csharp
    Camera.main.AddCommandBuffer(CameraEvent.AfterEverything, commandBuffer);
    ```

4. **Custom Material and Shader**: Create a custom material in code and assign a shader to it that will perform the depth comparisons.

    Either we're gonna do this in Unity Client-Side,
    or we're gonna programmatically add the materials and shaders to do the occlusion rendering on the phone

    ```csharp
    Material customMat = new Material(Shader.Find("Custom/DepthComparisonShader"));
    ```

5. **Apply Custom Material to AR Object**: Assign the custom material to your AR object.

see above

    ```csharp
    arObject.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = customMat;
    ```

6. **Set Depth Textures**: Send the real-world and AR object depth textures to the custom material for depth comparison.

see above

    ```csharp
    customMat.SetTexture("_RealWorldDepthTexture", depthTexture);
    customMat.SetTexture("_ARObjectDepthTexture", ARDepthTexture);
    ```

### Things to Do in Unity

1. **Main Camera**: Make sure you have a main camera set up and it’s aligned to capture the real world.

2. **AR Object**: Import or create your AR object in the Unity editor.

    this is going to be difficult phone-side - we'll have to add an object to the scene in order to test/see what's going on.

3. **Shader Creation**: Create a custom shader in Unity’s Shader Graph or via code for the depth comparison.

4. **Custom Material**: Create a custom material in Unity and assign the custom shader to it. You can also assign it via code, as mentioned above.

5. **Assign Material**: Manually assign the custom material to your AR object, if not done programmatically.

6. **Depth Texture**: If you are also capturing the depth texture through Unity (e.g., through a second camera), set up that camera.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Camera Setup**: Make sure the main camera is set up in Unity to capture the real-world view.

2. **Capture Real-world Depth**: Capture or import real-world depth information. If programmatically, use the existing code to populate `depthTexture`.

3. **Create Command Buffer**: Programmatically create a Command Buffer to capture this depth information.

4. **Attach to Camera**: Attach this Command Buffer to your main camera in the code.

5. **AR Object**: Import or create your AR object and place it in your scene in Unity. If your AR object is generated programmatically, ensure it is created before the rendering happens.

6. **Custom Shader**: Write or design a custom shader that can take two depth textures and perform depth comparisons.

7. **Custom Material**: Create a custom material and assign the custom shader to it, either in Unity editor or programmatically.

8. **Apply Material to AR Object**: Apply the custom material to your AR object. This can be done either manually in the Unity editor or programmatically.

9. **Set Depth Textures**: Before rendering, make sure to send the real-world depth texture and the AR object depth texture to your custom shader, typically via a C# script.

10. **Test and Debug**: Run the application and debug to make sure depth-based occlusion is working as expected. Modify the shader, Command Buffer, or material as needed.

By following this step-by-step guide, you should be able to implement depth-based occlusion between a real-world scene and an AR object.

another thing to consider would be to potentially include a button client side that 'hides' the depth image?
just thinking out loud! as evidenced by the exclamation point.
